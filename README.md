# Final Project UD2

## Introduction

In this project you will have to apply at least two different supervised learning algorithms seen in class (KNN, Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, SVM).

**Dataset**: [credit_train.csv](data/credit-train.csv) and [credit_test.csv](data/credit-test.csv)

## First steps

### Conda environment

Create a conda environment from [conda.yaml](conda.yaml)

```bash
conda env create -f environment/conda.yaml
```

Activate conda environment:

```bash
. activate [environment-name]
```

### Install pre-commit hooks

```bash
pre-commit install
```

## Best Model
